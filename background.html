		<h1>Background: What do we already know?</h1>
		
		<h2>Already Known (Music Theory side)</h2>
		<p>Again, there is not very much peer-reviewed music theory about K-Pop, but plenty of fans and at least one "edu-tainment" YouTube channel have explored this on their own for fun.</p>
		<p>The most striking characteristics of the genre include intense genre mixing (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvenA5r7R0" target="_blank">Sound Field, 2020</a>). Modern popular music often has distinct sounds for each section (verses, choruses, bridge, etc) by using a new set of chords or slightly different instrumentation, often in tandem with a new melody. However, K-Pop tends to <em>really</em> make sure listeners know when a new section has arrived, often switching entire genres when the time comes. K-Pop songwriters seem to use genre conventions as more of a toolset for writing music than a template (i.e. using different genres to invoke specific moods or tell a story instead of using genre conventions as a base on which to build further musical innovation).</p>
		<p>K-Pop groups are typically signed under large companies which help with training the artists, marketing, planning promotion schedules, writing and recording the music, as well as filming music videos. Many have dedicated in-house teams for each of these tasks, and sometimes even for each group. Because these companies play such a large role in managing and creating these groups, they can have massive influences on their groups' images, success, and styles. Some have even developed signature "company styles" (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0auG8NYafo" target="_blank">2ndgenbias, 2022)</a>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>SM Entertainment's willingness to release more experimental music that take K-Pop's genre mixing to the next level</li>
			<li>YG Entertainment's way of building on or developing choruses&mdash;the repeated, and often most exciting or memorable part, of most Western-style modern popular music
				<ul  class="sublist">
					<li> Many of their groups' tracks have choruses that are very stripped down and/or laid-back at first, leaving plenty of room to grow throughout the song. This culminates in a relatively loud and energetic final chorus meant to get listeners excited and be great live concert tracks. They also often come with an easy-to-follow choreography and an instrumental dance breakdown</li>
				</ul>

		<h2>Already Known (History side)</h2>
		<p>Korean popular music has been influenced by US musical cultures since Korea's post-colonial period starting in 1945, but that influence was not very pronounced (<a href="https://www.tobiashubinette.se/hallyu_1.pdf" target="_blank">Lie, 2012</a>). Listeners generally preferred their traditional folk music or trot music, which is a Korean adaptation of the Japanese enka style. It was not until Seo Taiji and the Boys exploded in popularity in 1992 that US-style hip-hop was brought into the mainstream. They were also among the pioneers of incorporating dance as a crucial part of popular music performance. </p>
		<p>The K-Pop industry as we know it now would grow from here thanks in part to the alignment of various factors. Sociopolitically, many East Asian walls of cultural protection weakening due to increased globalization after the Cold War, allowing for outside cultures to have much stronger presence and influence (<a href="https://www.tobiashubinette.se/hallyu_1.pdf" target="_blank">Lie, 2012</a>). Technologically, digital music distribution channels were improving in usability and accessibility. Socially, the inclusion of dance as a core part of K-Pop performances as well as the ability to post and access music and music videos online helped bridge language barriers (<a href="https://www.tobiashubinette.se/hallyu_1.pdf" target="_blank">Lie, 2012</a>).</p>
		<p>These factors all helped the first companies (like the "Big 3" of SM, JYP, and YG) to start promoting their groups both domestically and internationally. They began by exporting to China, Japan, and Taiwan, then gradually expanded from there (<a href="https://www.tobiashubinette.se/hallyu_1.pdf" target="_blank">Lie, 2012</a>). Having the music available through online distribution channels and having Korean immigrants spread the word also helped the industry gain small but loyal fanbases in many countries that they did not specifically promote to. These communities grew fairly slowly until BTS exploded onto the world stage in 2016 and 2017 and brought K-Pop into the mainstream in many places, most strongly in Western countries. In those 3 decades of growth, the industry has experiemented more and more with different genres and genre mixing.</p>
		
		<h2>Literature Gaps</h2>
		<p>A <em>vast</em> majority of the peer-reviewed K-Pop scholarship I found focuses on its history or its effects, like the psychology of stan culture, the influence of BTS, or the economic and political drivers of K-Pop as a cultural export. Almost nothing was about the music itself or how it works on a compositional, production, or artistic level.</p>
		<p>Thus, this field is a wide-open sandbox that I can explore, but I will focus on harmony and chord loops as that is where my preexisting interests lie. I will investigate: <b>how are 4-chord loops used in K-Pop, if at all? Do their loops largely mimic their Western counterparts or inspirations, or do they appear in very different and novel ways?</b></p>
		<p>The frameworks I will draw from for this study are:</p>
