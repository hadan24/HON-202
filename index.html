		<h1>Topic: Music Theory of K-Pop</h1>
		
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Though it is now a burgeoning subfield in music theory, contemporary popular music is sorely under-studied as a whole. Some of the reasons for this include a lack of time to properly study and publish about relatively new music as well as the enduring notion that contemporary popular music was "unworthy" of study compared to music of the Western classical canon. This gap becomes even more prominent as one looks beyond the sphere of Western popular music.</p>

		<h2>Why K-Pop specifically?</h2>
		<p>Besides my personal affinity for the genre, I (as a non-Korean) am focusing on this music scene specifically for its success abroad. The industry was intended to be marketed and sold both locally and overseas across east Asia since its modern incarnation began in the late 1990s. That strategy also gave it some small but dedicated fanbases around the world, and it has recently exploded in popularity and impact worldwide:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>"Stan culture" and "stan" behaviors have appeared repeatedly in the news on top of becoming a more regular word in online lexicon</li>
			<li>PSY's "Gangnam Style" music video was the most watched on YouTube in 2012</li>
			<li>boy group BTS have won multiple awards on Western music shows and broken several records</li>
			<li>K-Pop acts have been invited and performed at international festivals
				<ul class="sublist">
					<li>girl groups Blackpink, 2NE1, Aespa; hip-hop trio Epik High; and soloists Jackson Wang and BIBI have all performed at Coachella</li>
					<li>Dreamcatcher performed at Primavera Sound in Spain this June</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>conventions and festivals such as KPOP Flex in Europe and KCON in the US have appeared, giving fans from those areas an easier way to connect with each other and see their favorite artists</li>
		</ul>
		<p>With this project, I hope to contribute to a deeper understanding of this diverse music genre and how it differentiates itself harmonically from Western pop music that has traditionally dominated global popular music charts.</p>
