		<h1>Rationale: Why Chord Loops in K-Pop?</h1>
		
		<h2>Breaking Down the Question</h2>
		<b>How are 4-chord loops used in K-Pop, if at all? Do their loops largely mimic their Western counterparts or inspirations, or do they appear in very different and novel ways?</b>
		
		<p>With popular music theory being a relatively new field and K-Pop music theory in particular being almost brand new, almost anything goes. Popular harmony and chord loops are a relatively well-studied area in popular music, so I will draw on those models, seeing how they apply (if at all) to K-Pop, building on them in the context of K-Pop, and using them as a basis for comparing K-Pop to Western pop.</p>
		<p>Chord loops will be defined as any sequence of multiple chords that plays repeatedly with no changes (loops) at any part of the song. These are often 2 or 4 chords long, but can be longer.</p>
		<p>Since K-Pop has strong Western roots, but grew as a genre catering toward a completely different audience, I believe a comparison of their compositional styles and techniques may helpful or useful for future theorists to build off of.</p>

		<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
		<p>I hypothesize that the K-Pop music of each "generation" will use some similar loops to whatever Western music was popular at that time, but that as time progresses, chord loops idiomatic to the K-Pop industry and genre will develop and become increasingly common.</p>
		<p>If this is correct, then it shows that, while having strong roots in Western hip-hop and pop, K-Pop has developed its own harmonic language separate from those roots.</p>
		<p>If this is false, then it shows that the genre and industry has a lot more in common with Western pop than it may initially seem, and that our models for the latter can be more easily applied to the former.</p>
