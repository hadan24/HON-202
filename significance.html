		<h1>Significance: Why does this study matter?</h1>
		
		<p>This study would be among the first in music theory to study K-Pop, and likewise the first to apply existing frameworks for analyzing chord loops to that realm. It is an especially notable genre to study as its mixing of genre conventions encourages more experimentation across genre boundaries as oppossed to within them. This unique category of music is booming in popularity worldwide, challenging the decades-long dominance of Western artists in global charts. Its influence and reach are massive, and this study will hopefully help spark more scholarly musical analysis of and conversation around this unique genre.</p>
